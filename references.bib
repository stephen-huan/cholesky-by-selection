However, even a straightforward implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) requires O(n\^2) space and O(n\^3) time for a dataset of n examples. Several approximation methods have been proposed, but there is a lack of understanding of the relative merits of the different approximations, and in what situations they are most useful. We recommend assessing the quality of the predictions obtained as a function of the compute time taken, and comparing to standard baselines (e.g., Subset of Data and FITC).

We consider a relaxation of the full optimization formulation of this problem and then extend a well-established QR-based greedy algorithm for the optimal sensor placement problem without cost constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on data sets related to facial recognition, climate science, and fluid mechanics. This algorithm is scalable and often identifies sparse sensors with near optimal reconstruction performance, while dramatically reducing the overall cost of the sensors. We find that the cost-error landscape varies by application, with intuitive connections to the underlying physics. Additionally, we include experiments for various pre-processing techniques and find that a popular technique based on the singular value decomposition is often sub-optimal.},

Their flavor of spatially independent computation accommodates massive parallelization, meaning that they can handle designs two or more orders of magnitude larger than previously. However, accomplishing that feat can still require massive computational horsepower. Here we aim to ease that burden. We study how predictive variance is reduced as local designs are built up for prediction. We then observe how the exhaustive and discrete nature of an important search subroutine involved in building such local designs may be overly conservative. Rather, we suggest that searching the space radially, i.e., continuously along rays emanating from the predictive location of interest, is a far thriftier alternative. Our empirical work demonstrates that ray-based search yields predictors with accuracy comparable to exhaustive search, but in a fraction of the time\textemdash for many problems bringing a supercomputer implementation back onto the desktop.},

This article takes the alternative standpoint that the ordering of the observations can be tuned to sharpen the approximations. Advantageously chosen orderings can drastically improve the approximations, and in fact, completely random orderings often produce far more accurate approximations than default coordinate-based orderings do. In addition to the permutation results, automatic methods for grouping calculations of components of the approximation are introduced, having the result of simultaneously improving the quality of the approximation and reducing its computational burden. In common settings, reordering combined with grouping reduces Kullback-Leibler divergence from the target model by a factor of 80 and computation time by a factor of 2 compared to ungrouped approximations with default ordering. The claims are supported by theory and numerical results with comparisons to other approximations, including tapered covariances and stochastic partial differential equation approximations. Computational details are provided, including efficiently finding the orderings and ordered nearest neighbors, and profiling out linear mean parameters and using the approximations for prediction and conditional simulation. An application to space-time satellite data is presented.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes are widely used as priors for unknown functions in statistics and machine learning. To achieve computationally feasible inference for large datasets, a popular approach is the Vecchia approximation, which is an ordered conditional approximation of the data vector that implies a sparse Cholesky factor of the precision matrix. The ordering and sparsity pattern are typically determined based on Euclidean distance of the inputs or locations corresponding to the data points. Here, we propose instead to use a correlation-based distance metric, which implicitly applies the Vecchia approximation in a suitable transformed input space. The correlation-based algorithm can be carried out in quasilinear time in the size of the dataset, and so it can be applied even for iterative inference on unknown parameters in the correlation structure. The Euclidean- and correlation-based Vecchia approximations are equivalent for strictly decreasing isotropic covariances, but the correlation-based approach has two advantages for more complex settings: It can result in more accurate approximations, and it offers a simple, automatic strategy that can be applied to any covariance, even when Euclidean distance is not applicable. We demonstrate these advantages in several settings, including anisotropic, nonstationary, multivariate, and spatio-temporal processes. We also illustrate our method on multivariate spatio-temporal temperature fields produced by a regional climate model.},

We show that our general Vecchia approach contains many popular existing GP approximations as special cases, allowing for comparisons among the different methods within a unified framework. Representing the models by directed acyclic graphs, we determine the sparsity of the matrices necessary for inference, which leads to new insights regarding the computational properties. Based on these results, we propose a novel sparse general Vecchia approximation, which ensures computational feasibility for large spatial datasets but can lead to considerable improvements in approximation accuracy over Vecchia's original approach. We provide several theoretical results and conduct numerical comparisons. We conclude with guidelines for the use of Vecchia approximations in spatial statistics.},

There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1-1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

If the search space dimensionality is high, updating the covariance or its factorization is computationally expensive. Therefore, we adopt an algorithm from numerical mathematics for rank-one updates of Cholesky factors. Our methods results in a quadratic time covariance matrix update scheme with minimal memory requirements. The numerically stable algorithm leads to triangular Cholesky factors. Systems of linear equations where the linear transformation is defined by a triangular matrix can be solved in quadratic time. This can be exploited to avoid the additional iterative update of the inverse Cholesky factor required in some covariance matrix adaptation algorithms proposed in the literature. When used together with the (1+1)-CMA-ES and the multi-objective CMA-ES, the new method leads to a memory reduction by a factor of almost four and a faster covariance matrix update. The numerical stability and runtime improvements are demonstrated on a set of benchmark functions.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques.

  abstract = {The vast quantity of information brought by big data as well as the evolving computer hardware encourages success stories in the machine learning community. In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process regression (GPR), a well-known nonparametric, and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. However, they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable GPs in the GP community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this article is devoted to reviewing state-of-the-art scalable GPs involving two main categories: global approximations that distillate the entire data and local approximations that divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations that modify the prior but perform exact inference, posterior approximations that retain exact prior but perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations that exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable GPs are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues of scalable GPs in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.},

  abstract = {We present the fundamentals of a measure transport approach to sampling. The idea is to construct a deterministic coupling---i.e., a transport map---between a complex "target" probability measure of interest and a simpler reference measure. Given a transport map, one can generate arbitrarily many independent and unweighted samples from the target simply by pushing forward reference samples through the map. We consider two different and complementary scenarios: first, when only evaluations of the unnormalized target density are available, and second, when the target distribution is known only through a finite collection of samples. We show that in both settings the desired transports can be characterized as the solutions of variational problems. We then address practical issues associated with the optimization--based construction of transports: choosing finite-dimensional parameterizations of the map, enforcing monotonicity, quantifying the error of approximate transports, and refining approximate transports by enriching the corresponding approximation spaces. Approximate transports can also be used to "Gaussianize" complex distributions and thus precondition conventional asymptotically exact sampling schemes. We place the measure transport approach in broader context, describing connections with other optimization--based samplers, with inference and density estimation schemes using optimal transport, and with alternative transformation--based approaches to simulation. We also sketch current work aimed at the construction of transport maps in high dimensions, exploiting essential features of the target distribution (e.g., conditional independence, low-rank structure). The approaches and algorithms presented here have direct applications to Bayesian computation and to broader problems of stochastic simulation.},

In this work, we investigate the optimal design of experiments for estimation of linear functionals in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). This problem has been extensively studied in the linear regression setting under an estimability condition, which allows estimating parameters without bias. We generalize this framework to RKHSs, and allow for the linear functional to be only approximately inferred, i.e., with a fixed bias. This scenario captures many important modern applications, such as estimation of gradient maps, integrals, and solutions to differential equations. We provide algorithms for constructing bias-aware designs for linear functionals. We derive non-asymptotic confidence sets for fixed and adaptive designs under sub-Gaussian noise, enabling us to certify estimation with bounded error with high probability.},

The algorithm only needs to know the spatial configuration of the \$x\_\{i\}\$ and does not require an analytic representation of \$G\$. Furthermore, this factorization straightforwardly provides an approximate sparse PCA with optimal rate of convergence in the operator norm. Hence, by using only subsampling and the incomplete Cholesky factorization, we obtain, at nearly linear complexity, the compression, inversion and approximate PCA of a large class of covariance matrices. By inverting the order of the Cholesky factorization we also obtain a solver for elliptic PDE with complexity \$O ( N \textbackslash log\^\{d\}( N /\textbackslash epsilon) )\$ in space and \$O ( N \textbackslash log\^\{2d\}( N /\textbackslash epsilon) )\$ in time, improving upon the state of the art for general elliptic operators.},

Surprisingly, this problem has a closed-form solution that can be computed efficiently, recovering the popular Vecchia approximation in spatial statistics. Based on recent results on the approximate sparsity of inverse Cholesky factors of \$\textbackslash Theta\$ obtained from pairwise evaluation of Green's functions of elliptic boundary-value problems at points \$\textbackslash\{x\_\{i\}\textbackslash\}\_\{1 \textbackslash leq i \textbackslash leq N\} \textbackslash subset \textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$, we propose an elimination ordering and sparsity pattern that allows us to compute \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-approximate inverse Cholesky factors of such \$\textbackslash Theta\$ in computational complexity \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N \textbackslash log(N/\textbackslash epsilon)\^d)\$ in space and \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N \textbackslash log(N/\textbackslash epsilon)\^\{2d\})\$ in time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best asymptotic complexity for this class of problems. Furthermore, our method is embarrassingly parallel, automatically exploits low-dimensional structure in the data, and can perform Gaussian-process regression in linear (in \$N\$) space complexity. Motivated by the optimality properties of our methods, we propose methods for applying it to the joint covariance of training and prediction points in Gaussian-process regression, greatly improving stability and computational cost. Finally, we show how to apply our method to the important setting of Gaussian processes with additive noise, sacrificing neither accuracy nor computational complexity.},

In line with the development of our method, we present a simple view on sparse approximations for GP models and their underlying assumptions and show relations to other methods.},

In the context of statistics and machine learning, these transformations can be used to couple a tractable "reference" measure (e.g., a standard Gaussian) with a target measure of interest. Direct simulation from the desired measure can then be achieved by pushing forward reference samples through the map. Yet characterizing such a map--e.g., representing and evaluating it--grows challenging in high dimensions. The central contribution of this paper is to establish a link between the Markov properties of the target measure and the existence of low-dimensional couplings, induced by transport maps that are sparse and/or decomposable. Our analysis not only facilitates the construction of transformations in high-dimensional settings, but also suggests new inference methodologies for continuous non-Gaussian graphical models. For instance, in the context of nonlinear state-space models, we describe new variational algorithms for filtering, smoothing, and sequential parameter inference. These algorithms can be understood as the natural generalization--to the non-Gaussian case--of the square-root Rauch-Tung-Striebel Gaussian smoother.},

One simple way to reduce the computational burden is to base the predictor only on those observations nearest to x. As long as the number of observations used in the predictor is sufficiently large, one might generally expect the best predictor based on these observations to be nearly optimal relative to the best predictor using all observations. Indeed, this phenomenon has been empirically observed in numerous circumstances and is known as the screening effect in the geostatistical literature. For linear predictors, when observations are on a regular grid, this work proves that there generally is a screening effect as the grid becomes increasingly dense. This result requires that, at high frequencies, the spectral density of the random field not decay faster than algebraically and not vary too quickly. Examples demonstrate that there may be no screening effect if these conditions on the spectral density are violated.},

This phenomenon is called the screening effect. However, there are situations in which a screening effect does not hold in a reasonable asymptotic sense, and theoretical support for the screening effect is limited to some rather specialized settings for the observation locations. This paper explores conditions on the observation locations and the process model under which an asymptotic screening effect holds. A series of examples shows the difficulty in formulating a general result, especially for processes with different degrees of smoothness in different directions, which can naturally occur for spatial-temporal processes. These examples lead to a general conjecture and two special cases of this conjecture are proven. The key condition on the process is that its spectral density should change slowly at high frequencies. Models not satisfying this condition of slow high-frequency change should be used with caution.},

Based on this interpretation, we show that GPR can be accelerated and its memory consumption can be reduced while keeping the accuracy by dynamically forming the active set depending on the given input vector, where active set is the set of examples used for the regression. We call this method Dynamic Active Set (DAS). Based on DAS, we can extend the standard GPR, which estimates a scalar output with variance, to a regression method to estimate multidimensional output with covariance matrix. We applied our method to anomaly detection on real power plant and confirmed that it can detect prefault phenomena four days before actual fault alarm.},

  abstract = {This paper presents new results of the theoretical study of factorized sparse approximate inverse (FSAI) preconditionings. In particular, the effect of the a posteriori Jacobi scaling and the possibility of constructing FSAI preconditioners iteratively are analyzed. A simple stopping criterion for the termination of local iterations in constructing approximate FSAI preconditioners using the PCG method is proposed. The results of numerical experiments with 3D finite-element problems from linear elasticity are presented. Bibliography21 titles.},
